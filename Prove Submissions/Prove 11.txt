After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github and Heroku.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku):
  https://cse341-gh-site.herokuapp.com/

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
  https://github.com/hig19011/cse341-nodejs

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning.
  The page requests the initial list of Avengers after loading.
  It submits a new name and other info with a check for duplicates.
  It notifies clients when a name is updated.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
  None, all pieces are working.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
  The basics of socket.io were fun to learn.  It is cool to be able to push data to the client.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
   GraphQL is useful in certain niche cases, but is overkill for most websites, particularly the standard e-commerce and blogs site that are so common.  In most cases, I wouldn't recommend it over a standard REST API.  I would reduce the time spend on learning this topic for other relevant technologies.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements
    Category 5

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
  My site has extra styling, additional fields and easy to read and use socket.io implementations.
