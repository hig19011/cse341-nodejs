  It was nice to have the data go round trip without refreshing the page.  Page loading is fine when changing topics, but a self building page has a better feel to the end user.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
  Have some error handling as an above and beyond requirements.  APIs fail all of the time and dealing with it in a useful way for the user would be good practice.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements
    Category 5

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
  I added extra style to the page, allowed additional inputs on the insert, and gave some error message back when there were issues preventing the insert such as Duplicate Entries.
