After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github and Heroku.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku):
  https://cse341-gh-site.herokuapp.com/

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
  https://github.com/hig19011/cse341-nodejs

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning.
  The site pulls json from an API and Displays it in the web page.
  The site will filter based on keywords, kept from the Team Activity 3
  The site will paginate over the results.
  The pagination and filter work together to allow pagination over the filtered contents.
  The pagination is found at the top and bottom of the page.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
  All pieces are working.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
  It wasn't particularly interesting, but I did like how almost all the calculations and logic were done in the controller keeping most of the logic out of the view.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
  It was a straight forward assignment.  We implemented pagination, I don't think that I would anything.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate

    Category 5
